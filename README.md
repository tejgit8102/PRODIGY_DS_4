# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my data science internship project at Prodigy Infotech. The project focuses on analyzing sentiment patterns in Twitter data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards various topics, brands, and events.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes a collection of Twitter posts. 

## Analysis & Results
The sentiment analysis reveals key insights into prevailing attitudes and opinions within the Twitter community. The analysis shows a predominance of negative sentiments overall, but also highlights a broad spectrum of emotions across different topics. These insights can aid in shaping decision-making processes, marketing strategies, and community engagement both online and offline.

## Conclusion
